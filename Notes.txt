JAVA INTRO:->
Java Is Free, Open-source, Object oriented Programming Language.
Originally developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems and publicly released in 1995, as core component of sun microsystems java platform.

James Gosling and his team started/initiated a project in June 1991, with name 'OAK'.
This project was originally designed for interactive television, but it was so advanced for the  digital cable television industry at the time.
Due to some reason the project-Oak, renamed as Project Green; was later renamed as Java.

Sun microsystems released the first public implimentation as Java 1.0 in 1995.

- Java Is Simple and Small, soits easily programmable with a minimum of training.
- Java is Object oriented language,its gives access and achieve Inheritance, Encapsulation and polymorphism etc.
- Java is Portable and Interpreted language. Its B'oz, a java application is a combination of a compiled and interpreted language. The source code written into byte code , which is uniform/simiar/same for all machines.This byte code is compatible/suitable with java virtual machin(jvm/i.e.java interpreter),This jvm converts the byte code into specific machine for direct execution. That's why java is portable and interpreted language.
Java has automatic memory management
